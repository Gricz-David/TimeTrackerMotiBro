# TimeTrackerMotiBro

Unfortunately ran out of time before completing the Diagrams for the app.

Known issues: - while used on mobile, you can not edit the time cards. 

Could improve on: - responsiveness - while used on mobile it gets pretty cluttered, 
hard to use the filters whilst looking at the data.
                  - limiting the creation of timecards, so that the users are not 
                  able to create 2 time cards in the same time frame (objectively 
                  this might not even be needed)
